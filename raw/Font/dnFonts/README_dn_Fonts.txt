===============
The runic alphabet and nordic symbology has been co-opted (appropriated/stolen) 
by white supremacy and hate groups and should be used with that understanding. 

The following runes are most common:

(U+16C9) ALGIZ/EOLHX/EOLX/YR
(U+16DF) OTHALA/EOEL/ODAL
(U+16CF) TIWAZ/TIR/TYR
(U+16C3) JERA
(U+16CA) SOWILO/SIGEL looks close to and may be the origin of SIG/WOLFSANGEL

The following symbols are most common:

Swastika (Thule Society logo also similar)
Ravens of Odin
Odin's Valknut
Thor's Hammer (Mjolnir)
Sun Wheel and Black Sun (Thule Society logo also similar)
