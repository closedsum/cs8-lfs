Overall idea is not changing.
- In the Sky
- Big Ship
- Rainbow Bridge

Size

I think ultimately, we might need to show the World Tree more directly to
show the viewer the massive size of the ship we orginally talked about.

This is not necessarily the perspective. Just me trying to find images that show the
Tree and a character ... and we can insert the Ship and play with that.

Ship

Stationary? or Moving?

If Moving
- Do we adding Rowing Oars (many tiny ones ... to convey 100s of oars)
- Give the feeling the Ship is "swimming" at Tree Top / Clouds

Rainbow Bridge

- If it pops too much we can hide it more through the clouds. So you just see it through the clouds mostly.
- In my "bad" mockup ... I was also trying to show the bridge coming in / out of the Tree / Clouds
