Do we want the "top" of the World Tree very lightly peeking out?
- I think this will probably more come down to color. As long there is a sense of 
  of some green from the World Tree come out in a few pockets I that should be okay.
Orientation of the Ship is great!
How can we make the Ship feel bigger / even more dramatic?
Should have a small bit of the rainbow road directly coming from the ship.
-Also need a doorway on the ship, where the road is coming / leaving from.
