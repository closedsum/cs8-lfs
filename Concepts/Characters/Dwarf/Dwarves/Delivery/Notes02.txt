Skeleton Knight
- A2 and A3
-- Helmet and Shield designs are good
-- Helmet
--- A2 wings can be 30% bigger
--- A3 horns can be 30% bigger
-- Spear
--- Lets try to come up with with slightly more unique / exaggerated designs. You can push more into a Halberd, Polearm, or Scythe direction
if that helps.

I think the shoulder (pauldrons) designs should be varied as well. I think
this will help the characters feel a little more unique.
