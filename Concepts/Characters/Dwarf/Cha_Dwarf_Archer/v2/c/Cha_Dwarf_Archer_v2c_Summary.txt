NOTES:
- Rig: 
-- The documents provides a loose outline of how the bones should be laid out. Ultimately use your best judgment.
-- Please use the SAME bone names. It makes it easier for retargeting animations in Unreal
- Geometry:
-- Triangle counts are just a guideline. Most of the time you can use significantly less, but if you need to push more that is okay (as long its
NOT more than 2x the suggested triangle count).

Let me know if you have any questions.
