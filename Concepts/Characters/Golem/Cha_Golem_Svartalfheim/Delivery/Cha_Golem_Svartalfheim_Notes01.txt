TEXTURE

- The "weathering" effect looks really bad bc you can see the where the geometry comes splits
-- Do a better job of painting / blending this

Cha_Golem_Svartalfheim_texture_fixes05

- Make the eye look more like a gem (I provided a reference on how a gem should be painted)
-- Cha_Golem_Svartalfheim_example_eye_gem_cut

Cha_Golem_Svartalfheim_texture_fixes02

- Make the Rune / Lettering sharper. 
- Make the Letter as geometry.
-- it would be easier to texture / create a mask later

Cha_Golem_Svartalfheim_texture_fixes01

- These don't look like gems at all. Look at the reference I provide on how a stylized gem should look.
-- Create a gradient in the color from bottom to top (dark to light)
-- Make sure to do proper texturing of the "weathered" effeect at edges
-- All these gems occupy the same UV space, so they should look basically the same. You can rotate them
   differently so they don't all uniform
-- The example just illustrate the texturing not the color. It should still be pink / purple.

GEOMETRY

Cha_Golem_Svartalfheim_z_fighting_feet

- Z-fighting on the bottom of the feet
-- The player will probably see the feet when the Golem dies, so adjust this
   so there isn't any z-fighting.

Cha_Golem_Svartalfheim_eye_fix

- This just looks the eye is "stuck" on. Push the back of the geometry back so 
  it seems like the eye is more a part of the character

RIGGING

Cha_Golem_Svartalfheim_rigging_fixes01

- If I move the some of the spine bones, the Torso gets exposed.
-- Either weight the Torso better or extend the geometry of the Torso upwards so this
   doesnt happen.

Cha_Golem_Svartalfheim_hand_closed_position

- Put the default bose of the hand in a "closed" / fist position
-- You may need to add an extra row of "digits" / finger joints so it doesn't look awkward / bad

Cha_Golem_Svartalfheim_geometry_fixes01

- The bottom of the pelvis doesn't look symetrical
- Also, round out the geometry more
