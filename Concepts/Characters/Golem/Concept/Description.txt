"Realm Protector" or Golem
- Serves a guardian, 1 for each of the 9 realms
- Should strongly represent the elements of the particular realm 
  the Golem protects (i.e. an Rock Golem protects a rocky environment, this doesn't have to be exact just in that direction)
- All bipedal (two arms and two legs)
- The Golem is relatively big, see the scale comparison between
  Player (1), Boss (2), and Realm Protector (3)
- Feel free to exagerate / be creative with proporations
- Feel free to exaggerate the head
