Overall, great designs!

Something I missed in my description is an element, game play wise, 
that would light up or help communicate any actions from the Golem.

I found good elements already in your design for everything except maybe 3 and 5.

To give you and idea of elements I'm going to take with your design and "highlight" to 
communicate the Golem is doing an attack.

1. The Crystals jutting out.
2. The Guantlets / Hands
4. The Torso and Arms
6. The Torso
7. The Flame around the head and Arms
8. The Greenery / Branches around the Shoulders
9. The Shoulders and Wings around the Helmet

If you have better suggestions let me know as well :)

Nothing needs to be added, but if we can't find anything sorta "unique" then some element
might need to be added. 

3. Vanaheim
- Love your description and elements you incorporated make total sense.
- Not sure if incorporating 3 orbs either floating around or as a giant necklace?
-- That way the ORBs can glow

5. Helheim
- Also great description and incorporation of elements
- I think make the HOLE bigger. That way I can stick an FX inside the HOLE (maybe a black hole effect)
  whenever this Golem is about to do an attack. 

Small Adjustments

1. Svartalfhiem
- Add 1 additional crystal that is jutting out that is bigger than the rest
-- If this sounds cliche, let me know. Just making sure some elements are super clear to the player

8. Alfheim
- Add 1-2 more branches that are bigger

Make all the Rune markings "bolder" in your Color and Black / White sketches. I want to make it very
clear to the modeler the importance of that being shown.

Okay, sorry for the brain dump.

Summary.

1. Svartalfheim
- 1 BIGGER Crstal

3. Vanaheim
- 3 ORBs?

5. Helheim
- BIGGER HOLE

8. Alfheim
- 1-2 more BRANCHES that are BIGGER
