Hey! Sorry about the wait, it's been a little tricky to find all the characteristics of the various worlds. I'll explain some of the choices I made:

1 - Linked with the underground and mines
2 - More human-like since it's from the world of men
3 - Soft edges and triangle shape representing sorcery
4 - Coming from a cold world I went with an entirely ice golem
5 - I made it look a bit like the skeletons since it's protecting the world of the dead
6 - Since this world is costal I thought its body made of water with some rocks inserts
7 - At the opposite of n4 it's made from fire and lava
8 - Being the world of light elves I thought of a forest kind of golem
9 - Lastly The Asgard's protector which I made the most complex and less "nature" like. I was thinking of making him completely out of gold.

Let me know what you think about them and if everything's good I'll start the lineart and coloring
