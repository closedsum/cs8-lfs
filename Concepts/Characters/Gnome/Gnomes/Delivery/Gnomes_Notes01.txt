Again, great job on the concepts.

I think I might have confused you slightly and you did 12 concepts instead of 8, which is still
great! haha, but I just need 8 total for now.

I boiled it down to 5 that look mostly good as is (1, 2, 4, 5, 11, 12)

There are some minor adjustments to some of these.

2. Update Hat
- Hat should look more like reference 03.jpg. 
-- This will more more apparent in the side profile.
-- Front profile can just be slightly taller

5. I exaggerated the character's width and height a bit more
to make this character a "giant" gnome of sorts

11. Update Hat
-- Had should look more like reference 01.jpg

12. Attachments
- Include a leaf "attachment" and feather "attachment" variation like 
  reference 09.pg

You can take elements from the existing characters you have already created for the remaining 3.

Some clearer direction.

Hat variations
1. Use hat from reference 07.jpg
2. Use hat from reference 04.jpb (you can exaggerate this even more)
3. Use hat from reference 02.jpg (tall pumpkin)

Beard variations
1. Curly like from 03.jpg
2. Wide Bushy like 10.jpg
3. Wide Mustache like 11.jpg
