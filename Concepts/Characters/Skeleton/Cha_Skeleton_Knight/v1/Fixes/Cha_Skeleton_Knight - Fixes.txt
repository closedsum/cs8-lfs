GEOMETRY

Upper Torso
- Sides near the Lower Torso sections need to rounded out a little
- Back is not welded to the Mid secions, there is a gap / hole

Lower Torso
- Round out the geo a little

Character is "hollow"
- Look for underneath the character.
- The bottom should be "capped" / sealed
-- This will help with animation

Pelvis
- Round out the armor near the thighs (try to follow the concept a little more for this part)

RIGGING

- Thigh
-- bottom portion of thigh is not rigged properly to thigh_r and thigh_l

- spine_02
-- Missing from Rig

- Rename spine03 to spine+_03
