Summary

1x Character
- Skeleton King

1x Attachment
- Mace

Attached
- Guide
- Raw Images of poses and anything else you may need.

NOTES:

Rig
- Bone Layout is just a loose suggestion so you know the names and roughly the layout

Hand
- The hand doesn't need extra bones (for fingers, ... etc)
- The default "pose" for the hands can be closed, like the character is already holding something

Black Parts
- The Black parts (ribs, pelvis, eyes, and nose) are NOT hallow. That will be "filled" in by the
  texture.

Max Triangle Counts are just suggestions, use your best judgment.
