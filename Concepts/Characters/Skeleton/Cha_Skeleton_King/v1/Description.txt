Notes:
1. Like the previous models, you guys did a great job modeling and rigging it. Use the same approach with this model, by making the "head" elements separate so it makes rigging and skin weights easier / better.
2. This character is the TALLER as the standard unreal character (about 240 cm) (I'm using the Solder Brute as a reference). There is an image to give you a sense of scale.
3. This character is the TALLER as a previous model (about 240 cm), Cha_Hu_Brute (180 cm)
4. Feel free to improvise where needed
5. Triangle / Polygon is higher. So feel free to use more triangles where necessary.
