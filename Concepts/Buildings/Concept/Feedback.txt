Overall design is great!

Most of my feedback is aimed at "pushing" / exaggerating some elements to be a little clearer when looked form a top down / isometric perspective.

1. House of Magic
- Make the skull at the top bigger / more prominent

2. Bestiary
- Make the animal busts bigger / more prominant (maybe 2.5x bigger?)
- Make the cages bigger

3. Mercenary
- Add more spears / weapons propped up
- weapons should of different lengths and sizes

4. Blacksmith
- Exaggerate the fireplace more (overall structure plus the hole / pit area), this
  can dominate the "house" aspect of the building.

5. Herbalist
- A few more pots
- Hanging "potions"?


6. Bank
- Incorporate a scale somewhere?
-- Something indicate the weighing of gold / silver
