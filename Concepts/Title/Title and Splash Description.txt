Title

- Incorporate the roots of the World Tree (YGGDRASIL)
- Incorporate each of the 9 realms (most concepts I've seen they are Orbs, which I think should work?)

- Some ideas / references of roots + realms

Splash Screen

- Same composition as we talked about

- "Hero" sorta bottom right

- Looming Deathstar like Viking ship Left / Top Left
- The ship is like a "castle" on top of the World Tree

- The top of Tree is basically in the "clouds"
- Hopefully this inline with what you already suggested. A big Deathstar like ship in the background.
-- Except the "base" of the ship is the top of the World Tree. 
-- Its a mix of the tree and clouds.

- Rainbow (this can be small, sorry my mockup isn't the greatest) going down out of view. This is a nod to the bifrost / bridge.
- This also lets the viewer know that the mix of tree / clouds is indeed the World Tree.




General Thoughts
- From what I researched basically the 9 realms are "kinda" all connected via the World Tree
- I don't think we need to show the World Tree directly in anyway, just "hint" that it is there
- Some concepts have Valhalla (Valholl or whatever other variations they have on the spelling) sitting
  on "top" of the World Tree

- This game, Sons of Valhalla, already incorporates a ship and it makes more sense with their game :(
- Haha, so I guess its probably best not to have the ship in the Title at least.
